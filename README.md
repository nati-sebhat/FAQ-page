## Overview

### What I learned

 While building this simple FAQ webpage, I learned how to structure a web page using semantic HTML elements like <div>, <h1>, <p>, <ol>, and <ul>. I also gained experience linking a CSS file and using internal styles to control layout and design. I learned how to apply fonts, colors, spacing, and backgrounds using CSS, and how to style links with different states like :hover and :visited. Additionally, I discovered how to make the page more user-friendly by centering content and organizing sections clearly.
