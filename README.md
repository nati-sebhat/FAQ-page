## 📚 What I Learned

While building this simple FAQ webpage, I learned how to structure a web page using semantic HTML elements like `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ol>`, and `<ul>`.  
I also gained experience linking an external CSS file and using internal styles for layout and design.  
I learned how to apply fonts, colors, spacing, and background styling, and how to style links with pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:visited`.  
Additionally, I practiced making a visually clean and readable layout with centered and organized sections.
